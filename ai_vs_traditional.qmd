## Exploring the Nexus between Artificial Intelligence and Job Displacement: A Literature Review

Prakash Adhikari, faculty member of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Department of Conflict, Peace, and Development Studies at Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur, Nepal, explains how artificial intelligence (AI) is changing jobs in two significant ways. It is creating new types of jobs while at the same time causing problems for existing ones. AI, which is deeply based on technologies such as machine learning and robotics, is suitable for automating tasks and helping people do more valuable work. Simply put, AI can make work more productive but also brings risks such as job loss, skill gaps, and inequality.

Further studies reveal that jobs involving repetitive tasks, such as those in factories, office work, and some customer service roles, are most likely to become automated in the future. At the same time, new jobs are emerging in areas like data analysis, software development, and healthcare using AI. Higher-skilled jobs often benefit from AI by becoming more efficient and better paid, while many low- and middle-skill jobs are at serious risk of disappearing.

Adhikari suggests plans to help people adapt to these changes. These plans include providing training and lifelong learning opportunities, improving social safety nets like unemployment benefits, creating fair and clear AI rules in employment sectors, and pushing for innovation in smaller businesses outside of major tech centers. While AI-driven innovations offer many benefits, Adhikari urges caution, calling for more detailed research to understand how AI affects workers and what policies work best in different industries to reduce job loss while promoting new innovations.

## Modeling the Complex Interplay: Dynamics of Job Displacement and Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in a Socio-Economic Landscape

The research document, written and organized by three professors in the Department of Mathematics at Mizan-Tepi University, Tepi, Ethiopia, examines the impact of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) on job security and the economy, considering the relationship between AI and employment as an interconnected, evolving, and complex phenomenon. They focus on how the adoption of AI is changing the labor markets over time and under what conditions jobs are lost, transformed, or balanced with the introduction of automation. The argument is that a viewpoint centered on technology is inadequate, and that a thorough approach, incorporating feedback loops and nonlinear effects, is necessary to understand the long-term implications better. Their goal is to build a foundation that mitigates the adverse impact of AI while promoting its enhanced productivity.

The study employs the Lotka-Volterra model, also known as the predator-prey model, to illustrate the interaction between human jobs and AI capabilities. Analyzing the model reveals different outcomes, including job growth, job loss, the coevolution of jobs and AI, or the decline of both. The results of the model show that a situation with no jobs or AI is unstable; stable coexistence is possible if AI growth is controlled and human job creation experiences healthy growth. The outcome primarily depends on the speed of AI adoption, its productivity effects, and job creation.

The solution involves slowing down AI adoption to prevent shocks, investing in worker up-skilling, and fostering the development of job-creating industries. The article also suggests expanding the model to include wages, education, regulations, and capital flows, while, more importantly, using real data to view and manage accurate predictions. They suggest that suitable policies will enable the smooth integration of AI into the workplace, thereby reducing the negative impact on jobs and the livelihoods of employees.

## The Potential Impact of AI Innovations on U.S. Occupations

Amid the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries, this study presents a novel, data-driven approach to understanding how AI innovations influence U.S. occupations broadly and at the level of individual tasks. The authors develop an “AI Impact (AII)” measure using deep learning natural language processing to match 17,879 occupational task descriptions from O*NET with 24,758 AI-related patents filed between 2015 and 2022. By analyzing patent text and using advanced semantic models (Sentence-T5), the AII quantifies how closely each task aligns with emerging AI technologies. Unlike earlier, coarse-grained methods relying on manual labeling or broad skill categories, this approach captures subtler, task-specific dynamics of AI impact, offering a more accurate and scalable picture of automation potential across industries.

The study reveals that AI increasingly influences both routine and nonroutine tasks, challenging the belief that automation mainly threatens repetitive work. Occupations with high AI exposure like as software developers, cardiovascular technologists, and air traffic controllers are concentrated in structured, data-driven sectors like healthcare, IT, and manufacturing, where AI enhances diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and workflow optimization. Meanwhile, jobs in agriculture, construction, and hospitality remain less affected due to their reliance on manual and context-dependent skills. Overall, the study finds that AI’s labor impact is moderated by its role in augmenting rather than replacing human expertise and by ongoing workforce shortages in high-demand fields. Instead of widespread displacement, AI is reshaping work by redistributing effort, supporting complex decision-making, and amplifying productivity across industries.

## Employees’ Perceptions of the Implementation of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation (RAIA) on Job Satisfaction, Job Security, and Employability

As robotics and artificial intelligence reshape workplaces, this study examines how employees perceive these changes. Drawing on 21 interviews across consulting, accounting, and hospitality, it highlights both the efficiency gains of RAIA and the ongoing importance of human traits like empathy and creativity. The study found that while automation and AI enhance productivity and efficiency by removing repetitive tasks, human qualities like empathy, creativity, and judgment remain irreplaceable. Employees acknowledged both opportunities and threats in this transition and recognized  RAIA’s potential to improve job quality and satisfaction while also fueling fears about job loss, data privacy, and skill obsolescence.

This tension produces what the authors describe as a “job satisfaction dilemma,” where enthusiasm for innovation coexists with anxiety over job stability, privacy concerns, and the need for continuous skill development.Perceptions vary by role: knowledge-based employees see automation as a productivity partner, while those in routine positions feel more vulnerable. The research shows that successful RAIA adoption requires more than technology, as it also calls for transparent communication, ethical governance, and active workforce support.

By positioning RAIA as a tool to complement rather than compete with human labor, organizations can foster trust, adaptability, and long-term employability. Ultimately, the study underscores that in an age of intelligent machines, human adaptability, emotional insight, and lifelong learning remain the foundation of meaningful work.

## Redefining careers in the age of artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the job market by both displacing certain roles and creating new opportunities. Routine and manual tasks, such as telemarketing, retail work, and data entry, are increasingly automated, while jobs requiring empathy, creativity, and complex problem-solving, like teaching, healthcare, and design, remain resilient. This shift highlights the evolving collaboration between humans and machines.

New roles are emerging to support AI systems, including positions that train AI, interpret AI decisions for humans, and ensure responsible and ethical AI practices. Industries across finance, healthcare, education, and technology are creating specialized positions that complement human skills rather than replace them entirely. These roles emphasize the importance of technical expertise, interdisciplinary knowledge, and ethical awareness.

To succeed in an AI-driven workforce, individuals and businesses must focus on skill development, adaptability, and lifelong learning. Key skills include data literacy, familiarity with AI, emotional intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving. Businesses can support this transition by integrating AI responsibly, fostering innovation, and providing opportunities for upskilling, ensuring that human capabilities continue to thrive alongside technological advancements.
