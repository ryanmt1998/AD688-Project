    "text": "1 Unsupervised Clustering\nAs a group, Ryan and Tracy will be implementing an unsupervised clustering model using the K-mean algorithm. They are seeking to differentiate AI-related jobs postings from non-AI ones. AI-related job postings will be defined by AI-related keywords. The results will serve to tell them how how certain features separate AI-related job postings from non-AI.\n\n\n2 Features and Silhouette Score\nThey will be using the following features for our clustering model:\n\nAverage Salary, expected to capture pay differences\nJob Title (Encoded), expected to capture role differences\nNAICS Code (Encoded), expected to separate jobs by sectors\nAverage Years of Experience, expected to capture experience level differences\n\nGrouping these features in a cluster of 2, they found a silhouette score of approximately 0.695, indicating a good clustering structure. However, since the score is not closer to 1 than expected, reflecting the complexity between AI and non-AI job postings.\n\n\n\nIS_AI_ROLE\nCLUSTER\ncount\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n47\n\n\n1\n1\n19\n\n\n0\n0\n2195\n\n\n0\n1\n1669\n\n\n\nThe table shows the count of jobs by AI role and cluster. There are 66 AI - Labeled jobs total. Non - AI jobs are more numerous, with 3,864 present in the data set.\n\n\n3 Pairwise Plots\nBelow are a series of pairwise plots showing the relationships between the features used in the clustering model, consisting of Average Salary, Job Title (Encoded), NAICS Code (Encoded), and Average Years of Experience. The plots seek to visualize how these features interact and potentially separate AI-related job postings from non-AI ones. From the plots, a clear relationship is not visible between the features due to the lower number of AI-related job postings in the dataset.\nIt would be unusual to see any AI jobs since AI jobs are not common in the hiring process. The few present in the visualizations are likely the ones that require higher technical skills in the ML domain. To further study our prompt, other processes will need to be performed.\nView Interactive Plots\n\n\n4 PCA 2D Visualization Excluding Salary\nGenerating a 2D PCA plot excluding salary to visualize the clustering of AI-related and non-AI jobs based served as a useful alternative to the previous pairwise plots. The following PCA plots consist of PC1 vs PC2, PC1 vs PC3, and PC2 vs PC3.\nThe PC1 vs PC2 plots shows some separation between clusters along PC1, but a lot of overlap along PC2. The PC1 vs PC3 plot demonstrates a clearer separation between the clusters, with cluster groups more distinctly divided along PC3. The PC2 vs PC3 presents moderate cluster separation, with the appearance of vertical banding along PC2.\nThe results of the PCA plots indicate the there are now two visually distinct clusters, which is an improvement from the previous pairwise plots. However, there is still confusion regarding which features strongly divide AI-related job postings from non-AI ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n5 PCA Loadings Table\n\n\n\nVariable\nPCA1\nPCA2\nPCA3\n\n\n\n\nTITLE_ENCODED\n-0.999826\n0.018638\n-0.000502\n\n\nNAICS_ENCODED\n-0.018640\n-0.999809\n0.005905\n\n\nAVG_YEARS_EXPERIENCE\n-0.000392\n0.005913\n0.999982\n\n\n\nLoading the data set, PC1 is entirely dominated by TITLE_ENCODED, with a coefficient of 0.999. This means the differences in job titles are the main factor separating the clusters. The second largest variance, PC2, is dominated by NAICS_ENCODED with a coefficient of 0.998, indicating that the industry sector is the next most important factor. PC3 is dominated by AVG_YEARS_EXPERIENCE with a coefficient of 0.999, suggesting that experience level is also a significant factor in distinguishing between job postings, which could lead to differences in salary.\n\n\n6 Differences Between AI and Non-AI Job Postings Using K-Means Clustering\nUsing K-means clustering, they identified two clusters in their dataset through a series of processes including selecting features, calculating a silhouette score, and visualizing the data using PCA 2D plots. Although this is an unsupervised learning method, the clusters likely correspond to AI-related and non-AI jobs postings based on the features used. Clusters are primarily separated by job titles, a strong indicator of whether a job is AI-related. Industry classification and experience level also play a role in distinguishing between the two types of job postings. The process, while not definitive, provides insights into the characteristics that differentiate AI-related jobs postings from non-AI ones in the dataset.\n\n\n7 A Table Displaying AI Related Jobs\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+----------+--------------------+\n|TITLE_RAW                                                                 |NAICS_2022_6|AVG_SALARY|AVG_YEARS_EXPERIENCE|\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+----------+--------------------+\n|Data / AI / ML Analyst - Full time / Onsite Venice, FL                    |424210      |77500.0   |2.0                 |\n|Senior AI Engineer                                                        |334111      |183250.0  |5.0                 |\n|Data Analyst - BI & AI                                                    |237310      |89500.0   |2.0                 |\n|Platform Architect - Analytics AI/ML (Remote)                             |221118      |168150.0  |8.0                 |\n|Government and Public Sector - AI & Data Analyst (TS/SCI Clearan NEW      |541211      |99850.0   |1.0                 |\n|Platform Architect - Analytics AI/ML (Remote)                             |221118      |168150.0  |8.0                 |\n|Data Analyst - Generative AI Specialist                                   |541512      |95000.0   |1.0                 |\n|Enterprise Ai/Ml Architect                                                |561311      |107500.0  |3.0                 |\n|Enterprise AI/ML Architect                                                |517121      |107500.0  |3.0                 |\n|Platform Architect - Analytics AI/ML (Remote)                             |221118      |168150.0  |8.0                 |\n|(USA) Senior, Data Analyst - Data Science and AI f...                     |455211      |117500.0  |3.0                 |\n|(USA) Senior, Data Analyst - Data Science and AI for Corporate Real Estate|455211      |117500.0  |3.0                 |\n|Enterprise AI/ML Architect                                                |517121      |107500.0  |3.0                 |\n|Data Analyst - Generative AI Specialist                                   |541512      |115000.0  |1.0                 |\n|Enterprise AI/ML Architect                                                |517121      |107500.0  |3.0                 |\n|Data Analyst - BI & AI                                                    |237310      |89500.0   |2.0                 |\n|Data Analyst - BI & AI                                                    |237310      |89500.0   |2.0                 |\n|SAP ABAP Consultant with GEN AI                                           |541511      |122501.5  |8.0                 |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+----------+--------------------+\n\n\nThe above table presents a case where experienced, or in other words, highly skilled jobs meet the criteria for being deemed AI jobs. This table supports the idea that experienced positions are closely associated with AI, considering their complexity.\n\n\n8 Logistic Regression Analysis\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nROC AUC\n0.6200\n\n\nAccuracy\n0.6384\n\n\nPrecision\n0.0290\n\n\nRecall\n0.5152\n\n\nF1 Score\n0.0549\n\n\n\nThey assessed the relationship between job characteristics and the likelihood of a role being AI-related using logistic regression. The model incorporated variables such as industry classification (NAICS codes), job titles, and experience levels, and they applied weights to account for the class imbalance, as AI-related postings represent a small minority of all jobs. From the analysis, they deduced that industries like information, software, and professional and technical services had a higher probability of including AI-related roles. Experience level contributed modestly, indicating that AI positions tend to require more specialized or senior expertise. The model achieved an ROC AUC of approximately 0.62 and an accuracy of 0.63, suggesting that while the logistic regression captured some patterns distinguishing AI and non-AI postings, there remains substantial overlap across industries and experience levels.\n\n\n9 Decision Tree Classifier\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nROC AUC\n0.4832\n\n\nAccuracy\n0.9765\n\n\n\nRyan and Tracy then developed a decision tree classifier to better understand the factors that differentiate AI-related roles from non-AI ones. The tree achieved a high accuracy of about 97%, but its ROC AUC of 0.48 revealed that it primarily predicted the majority (non-AI) class correctly and struggled to identify minority AI postings. From the splits, they deduced that industry classification was the strongest predictor, consistently appearing near the root, while experience acted as a secondary factor. This suggests that whether a job is AI-related depends first on the industry and then on the required level of expertise. The results also highlighted the strong imbalance in AI postings, with only a few sectors consistently containing these roles.\n\n\n10 Decision Tree Visualization\n\nFinally, they visualized the tree using Matplotlib to interpret the model’s decision logic. The first split on industry demonstrated that most sectors contained predominantly non-AI jobs. Subsequent splits based on years of experience showed that AI-related postings cluster mainly in technology- or data-driven sectors, particularly for positions requiring moderate-to-high experience. Most terminal nodes predicted non-AI roles, reinforcing that AI positions are still a niche subset of the job market. Overall, the visualization confirmed our earlier deduction: AI job prevalence is concentrated in a few industries, and while experience plays a supporting role, industry type is the dominant factor in identifying AI-focused roles."

It is creating new types of jobs while at the same time causing problems for existing ones. AI, which is deeply based on technologies such as machine learning and robotics, is suitable for automating tasks and helping people do more valuable work. Simply put, AI can make work more productive but also brings risks such as job loss, skill gaps, and inequality.\nFurther studies reveal that jobs involving repetitive tasks, such as those in factories, office work, and some customer service roles, are most likely to become automated in the future. At the same time, new jobs are emerging in areas like data analysis, software development, and healthcare using AI. Higher-skilled jobs often benefit from AI by becoming more efficient and better paid, while many low- and middle-skill jobs are at serious risk of disappearing (Adhikari (2024)).\nAdhikari suggests plans to help people adapt to these changes. These plans include providing training and lifelong learning opportunities, improving social safety nets like unemployment benefits, creating fair and clear AI rules in employment sectors, and pushing for innovation in smaller businesses outside of major tech centers. While AI-driven innovations offer many benefits, Adhikari urges caution, calling for more detailed research to understand how AI affects workers and what policies work best in different industries to reduce job loss while promoting new innovations (Adhikari (2024))."

The authors develop an “AI Impact (AII)” measure using deep learning natural language processing to match 17,879 occupational task descriptions from O*NET with 24,758 AI-related patents filed between 2015 and 2022. By analyzing patent text and using advanced semantic models (Sentence-T5), the AII quantifies how closely each task aligns with emerging AI technologies. Unlike earlier, coarse-grained methods relying on manual labeling or broad skill categories, this approach captures subtler, task-specific dynamics of AI impact, offering a more accurate and scalable picture of automation potential across industries (Septiandri, Constantinides, and Quercia (2024)).\nThe study reveals that AI increasingly influences both routine and nonroutine tasks, challenging the belief that automation mainly threatens repetitive work. Occupations with high AI exposure like as software developers, cardiovascular technologists, and air traffic controllers are concentrated in structured, data-driven sectors like healthcare, IT, and manufacturing, where AI enhances diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and workflow optimization. Meanwhile, jobs in agriculture, construction, and hospitality remain less affected due to their reliance on manual and context-dependent skills (Septiandri, Constantinides, and Quercia (2024)). Overall, the study finds that AI’s labor impact is moderated by its role in augmenting rather than replacing human expertise and by ongoing workforce shortages in high-demand fields. Instead of widespread displacement, AI is reshaping work by redistributing effort, supporting complex decision-making, and amplifying productivity across industries."

This priority was heavily influenced by remote work, which helped maintain industries during the COVID-19 lockdown mandates. However, as society moves past the time of quarantine, it is becoming a prevalent question whether this multitude of remote jobs, which offer flexibility, will be carried forward into the future.\nThe pie chart illustrates how the lack of proper documentation can impact analysis, as 78.3% of jobs are not classified as remote, hybrid remote, or non-remote. Although this took up the larger portion of the diagram, 17% of those jobs are Remote, with another 3.11% being Hybrid remote (some days in-office and others virtually), which accounts for a fifth of all job postings. This demonstrates that flexible work arrangements are an essential factor for both the industry, in terms of their expectations for performance, as well as applicants and their need for a healthy balance between work and personal life.\nAdditionally, less than 2% of jobs are not Remote or are completely on-site, which further corroborates the idea that employers prefer and advertise flexibility over strict in-person requirements."

As AI technologies automate specific tasks and enhance human capabilities, questions emerge around how they create new opportunities and disrupt career paths. To answer this increasingly prevalent question, understanding the evolving landscape of AI versus non-AI careers is essential for employees and policymakers navigating this evolving landscape. Together, Ryan and Tracy’s research and analysis aim to explore how AI impacts job security, its presence in 2024, and its potential evolution in the future.\n\n\n2 Research Rationale\nThe ongoing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace presents complex implications for the future of employment. As AI continues to develop, it influences which jobs potentially exist in the future and how work will be structured. This makes it crucial to research the broader effects of AI beyond immediate automation concerns.\nIn 2024, the adoption of AI is still uneven, and its impact may not yet be fully visible in many datasets. By investigating and researching trends and early signs of influence, this study aims to provide a foundation that can guide strategies for future employment practices.

This lead is followed by other sectors, such as Custom Computer Programming Services, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, Employment Placement Agencies, and Computer Systems Design Services, in descending order by value and number of job postings, ranging from 4,000 to 5,000.\nThe remaining industries comprise a significantly smaller number of postings, indicating their low representation. This lower hiring demand could be a result of a lack of interest in the field from college graduates and skilled professionals, or the lack of proper outreach about such industries to the general public. Either way, the industries that deal with computer-based technology have higher volumes of job postings to meet the demand of companies and other businesses within their sector."

    "text": "Salary Distribution by Industry\n\nAs salary is a strong determining factor in people’s choice of career and deciding between industries, it is essential to evaluate how 20 industries, as published by NAICS, compensate their talent across the board. Some industries, such as Software Publishers, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and Web Search Portals and All Other Information Services, display wide salary spreads, indicated by tall boxes in the plot. These industries also have significantly high-salary outliers, with salaries reaching almost $500k.\nThe median and interquartile ranges also differ between industries. For example, the Temporary Help Services and Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers industries have a tighter cluster of salaries, indicating more consistent pay ranges across various subsectors and titles, as well as other levels of seniority, unlike the other widespread industries, where salary expectations might differ drastically from company to company or region to region.\nOverall, this distribution highlights how industry choice can also impact earning potential in the long run, potentially capping salaries despite years of experience, skill set, or educational level."

    "text": "Remote vs. On-Site Jobs\n\nFollowing 2020, there has been a significant increase in the need for work-life balance. This priority was heavily influenced by remote work, which helped maintain industries during the COVID-19 lockdown mandates. However, as society moves past the time of quarantine, it is becoming a prevalent question whether this multitude of remote jobs, which offer flexibility, will be carried forward into the future.\nThe pie chart illustrates how the lack of proper documentation can impact analysis, as 78.3% of jobs are not classified as remote, hybrid remote, or non-remote. Although this took up the larger portion of the diagram, 17% of those jobs are Remote, with another 3.11% being Hybrid remote (some days in-office and others virtually), which accounts for a fifth of all job postings. This demonstrates that flexible work arrangements are an essential factor for both the industry, in terms of their expectations for performance, as well as applicants and their need for a healthy balance between work and personal life.\nAdditionally, less than 2% of jobs are not Remote or are completely on-site, which further corroborates the idea that employers prefer and advertise flexibility over strict in-person requirements."

The model incorporated variables such as industry classification (NAICS codes), job titles, and experience levels, and they applied weights to account for the class imbalance, as AI-related postings represent a small minority of all jobs. From the analysis, they deduced that industries like information, software, and professional and technical services had a higher probability of including AI-related roles. Experience level contributed modestly, indicating that AI positions tend to require more specialized or senior expertise. The model achieved an ROC AUC of approximately 0.62 and an accuracy of 0.63, suggesting that while the logistic regression captured some patterns distinguishing AI and non-AI postings, there remains substantial overlap across industries and experience levels."

The first split on industry demonstrated that most sectors contained predominantly non-AI jobs. Subsequent splits based on years of experience showed that AI-related postings cluster mainly in technology- or data-driven sectors, particularly for positions requiring moderate-to-high experience. Most terminal nodes predicted non-AI roles, reinforcing that AI positions are still a niche subset of the job market. Overall, the visualization confirmed our earlier deduction: AI job prevalence is concentrated in a few industries, and while experience plays a supporting role, industry type is the dominant factor in identifying AI-focused roles."
