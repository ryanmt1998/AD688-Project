Such values help improve the attractiveness of an industry to students, career changers or other industries looking to collaborate.\nThe bar chart depicts the job postings by industry, with a majority of postings within a select few industries. An Unclassified Industry has the highest amount of postings, amassing over 9,000. This lead is followed by other industries such as Custom Computer Programming Services, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, Employment Placement Agencies, and Computer Systems Design Services in descending value and number of job postings between 5,000 and 4,000.\nThe remaining industries amount to a much smaller number of postings, which indicates their low representation. This lower hiring demand could be a result of disinterest in field from college graduates and skilled professionals or the lack of proper outreach about such industries to the general public. Either way, it is evident that the industries that deal with computer-based technology have higher volumes of job postings to meet the demand of companies and other businesses within their sector."

Some industries like Software Publishers, Administrative Management and General Management Consultant Services, and Web Search Portals and All Other Information Services display wide salary spreads, indicated by tall boxes in the plot. These industires also have large high-salary outliers, with salaries reaching almost $500k.\nThe median and interquartile ranges also differ between industries. For example, the Temporary Help Services and Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers industries have the tighter cluster of salaries, suggesting more consistent pay ranges in various subsectors and across titles and other levels of seniority. Unlike the other widespread industries, where salary expectations might differ drastically from company to company or region to region.\nOverall, this distribution highlights how industry choice can also affect earning potential in the long-run and cap salaries despite years of experience, skillset, or educational level."

However, as society moves past the time of quarantine, it is becoming a prevalent question on if these multitude of remote jobs that offer flexibilty would be carried along into the future.\nThe piechart shows how the lack of proper documentaion can affect analysis as 78.3% of jobs are not classified as remote, hybrid remote, or not remote. Although, this took up the larger portion of the diagram, 17% of those jobs are Remote, with another 3.11% being Hybrid remote (some days in-office and others virtually), which account for a fifith of all job postings. This demonstrates that flexible work arrangements are an important factor to both the industry, in terms of their expecations for performance, as well as applicants and their need to for a healthy balance between work and personal life.\nAdditionally, less than 2% of jobs are not Remote or are completely on-site which further corroborates the idea that employers prefer and adveritse flexibilty over strict in-person requirements."

The same can be said for Tracy, who can also work on improving her efficiency with Python. Both individuals have similar skill gaps, but Ryan’s experience with Python can be leveraged to help Tracy with future challenges. Ryan can review Tracy’s Python code, providing feedback to help her write cleaner and more efficient code. Given both Ryan’s and Tracy’s other skill sets, using recommended resources will be essential in further developing their abilities.\nA valuable platform to improve and familiarize oneself with these topics is DataCamp, an online learning platform that helps aspiring data analysts and engineers learn data analytics through engaging activities. The platform offers several resources for learning data analysis, such as webinars, code-alongs, tutorials, blogs, and podcasts. DataCamp is also designed to accommodate individuals at different levels, offering courses for beginners, intermediate, and advanced learners. The website provides courses in Python, R, Cloud Computing, AWS, and Docker—topics that Ryan and Tracy are seeking to improve in.\nAnother resource to consider is Fullstack Academy, an online bootcamp for data analytics. The bootcamp helps individuals gain the skills needed to advance their career paths in coding, data analytics, AI, and Machine Learning, with the promise that students will develop their skills in 26 weeks. The data analytics bootcamp at Fullstack offers students a live online classroom environment that includes live instruction, exercises, and team projects. The curriculum covers data analytics with Excel, SQL, and Python, while also addressing the latest essentials of generative AI. This platform would provide Ryan and Tracy with essential building blocks to further their coding skills."
