# Team Membersâ€™ Skill Proficiency Levels


A numerical scale (1-5) to indicate proficiency levels:  
- 1 = Beginner  
- 2 = Basic Knowledge  
- 3 = Intermediate  
- 4 = Advanced  
- 5 = Expert

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd

skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Tracy", "Ryan"],
    "Python": [3, 4],
    "SQL": [4, 3,],
    "Machine Learning": [2, 2],
    "Cloud Computing": [2, 2],
    "R": [3,4],
    "AWS": [1,1]


}

df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)
df_skills.set_index("Name", inplace=True)
df_skills
```

# Team Skill Levels Heatmap
```{python}
#| echo: false
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(df_skills, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Team Skill Levels Heatmap")
plt.show()
```

# Job Market vs. Team Skill Coverage
```{python}
#| echo: false
from collections import Counter

# Assuming job_descriptions is a list of text from job postings
top_skills = ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning", "Cloud Computing","R", "Docker", "AWS"]
job_skill_counts = Counter(top_skills)

# Compare with team skill levels
for skill in top_skills:
    if skill not in df_skills.columns:
        df_skills[skill] = 0  # Assume no knowledge in missing skills

df_skills
```

## Compare Team Skills to Industry Requirements

Working in the IT department requires various technological skills, ones that Ryan and Tracy will need to meet industry requirements. The top skills in this line of work include experience with Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, R, Docker, and AWS. Ryan and Tracy have good experience using Python, SQL, and R, but need to improve their efficiency in Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, while familiarizing themselves with Docker and AWS, where they have little to no experience. 


## Improvement Plan

Although there is room for improvement in their Python, SQL, and R skills, Ryan and Tracy should prioritize enhancing their efficiency in Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, AWS, and Docker, to achieve a well-rounded skill set.
