# Team Membersâ€™ Skill Proficiency Levels


A numerical scale (1-5) to indicate proficiency levels:  
- 1 = Beginner  
- 2 = Basic Knowledge  
- 3 = Intermediate  
- 4 = Advanced  
- 5 = Expert

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd

skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Tracy", "Ryan"],
    "Python": [2, 4],
    "SQL": [3, 3,],
    "Machine Learning": [2, 2],
    "Cloud Computing": [2, 2],
    "R": [4,4],
    "AWS": [2,1]


}

df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)
df_skills.set_index("Name", inplace=True)
df_skills
```

# Team Skill Levels Heatmap
```{python}
#| echo: false
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(df_skills, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Team Skill Levels Heatmap")
plt.show()
```

# Job Market vs. Team Skill Coverage
```{python}
#| echo: false
from collections import Counter

# Assuming job_descriptions is a list of text from job postings
top_skills = ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning", "Cloud Computing","R", "Docker", "AWS"]
job_skill_counts = Counter(top_skills)

# Compare with team skill levels
for skill in top_skills:
    if skill not in df_skills.columns:
        df_skills[skill] = 0  # Assume no knowledge in missing skills

df_skills
```

## Compare Team Skills to Industry Requirements

Working in the IT department requires a diverse set of skills that Ryan and Tracy will need to to develop to meet industry standards. The top skills in this line of work include experience with Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, R, Docker, and AWS. While Ryan has solid experience with Python, SQL, and R, Tracy has only limited experience with Python. Both need to improve their proficiency in Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and AWS while familiarizing themselves with Docker, where they currently have no experience.


## Improvement Plan

Although there is room for improvement in Python, SQL, and R skills, Ryan should prioritize enhancing their efficiency in Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, AWS, and Docker to achieve a well-rounded skill set. The same can be said for Tracy, who can also work on her efficiency with Python.
